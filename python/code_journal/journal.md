Today's goals:
* Creating a new repository for javascript 'content'. 
* Pratice the new knowledge gained over functions and methods in javascript such as:
  querySelector, for-loop, conditional, forEach etc.

What I've learned about:
1. Javascript is more contrived compared to Python. 
2. Javascript syntax is faraway to become second nature. 
3. More practice is needed.
